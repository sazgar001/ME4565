%% Load the non-uniform distribution of nodes


%% Rescale the nodes so that the maximum value is R
R = 0.5;


%% Set the upper and lower bounds for the step size


%% For 20 iterations, perform a DPA to determine the largest time step
% that produces a stable result


%% Run a full simulation with the time step to determine the radial spin up time
